# umbraco_flowmaster
The Flowmaster is an easy-to-use tool, enabling you to create flowcharts and organizational charts in the Umbraco backend to display on your site.
The special thing about the Flowmaster is that it is integrated with the Content and Media sections in Umbraco.

This means... 
  Flowcharts: ...that you can add content (via a Richtext Editor) to each Flowchart step, which will appear as a popup on your site.
  Orgcharts: ...that you will have the ability to add portraits for each employee to your Orgcharts.
  
Happy drawing!
